# Airtag Dissertation
A repository made to hold the code for my dissertation on the Apple AirTag/ Find My network

Everything in the OpenHaystack folder is creditted to:  https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack, but I have modified some of their code, like their BoringSSL obj C file, adding more uncompression methods etc.

Everything in the AirTag folder is mt work. I plan to update this library more in the future, as most of the swift code is run in the constructor of the view class and dumps everything out to the terminal. To open and use: MacOS 12 with Xcode 13 or above is required.
